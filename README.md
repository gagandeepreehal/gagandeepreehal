Gagandeep Reehal is co-founder & CEO of Minus Zero, an autonomous mobility startup based out of India.

Closely working at an intuitive intersection of neuroscience, AI & cognitive computing, he is working on a radical shift in how autonomous vehicle problem statement is perceived - taking small steps towards AGI and major leaps towards autonomy.

He has three book publications to his credit, has mentored/judged 65+ developer/hacking events worldwide and spoken at multiple conferences around AI & robotics.

Minus Zero is accelerating the world's transition to autonomous mobility, taking up an unconventional approach towards vision-only autonomy in the trickiest of traffic conditions, drawing inspiration from the human brain to develop the world's most human-like driving experience. 

From becoming the first company to test an autonomous vehicle on public roads in India, it's been an exponential journey ever since.
